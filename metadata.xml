    <description>[h3]Description[/h3]
This mod adds a special beggar into the game - The Dungeon Master! Meet him in the arcade to play an Isaac-adapted version of a very popular board game - &quot;Caves n' Creatures&quot;! Featuring:
[list]
    [*]6 new enemies to encounter during your quest alongside familiar ones.
    [*]A new boss to fight against, exclusive to the minigame!
    [*]A unique prompt system as your method of immersing yourself in the world.
    [*]Change your fate with one of the four original cast of Isaac characters, the consumables you collect, and of course, the roll of the die!
    [*]Up to three other players in your run able to play with you in the minigame!
[/list]

[h3]Important Notes[/h3]
[list]
[*]This mod was stitched together last minute and may be prone to bugs.
[*]It is not recommended you exit and continue the run during the minigame. It may break, it may not.
[*]Improvements to the flow of the minigame and overall quality will come around soon!
[/list]
