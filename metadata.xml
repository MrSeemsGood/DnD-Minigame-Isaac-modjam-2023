    <description>[h1]Description[/h1]
This mod adds a special beggar into the game - The Dungeon Master! Meet him in the arcade to play an Isaac-adapted version of a very popular board game - &quot;Caves n' Creatures&quot;! Featuring:
[list]
    [*] 6 new enemies to encounter during your quest;
    [*] a new boss to fight against, exclusive to the minigame!
    [*] a unique prompt system, where your fate is decided based on what character you choose to play (4 available!), what consumables you have, and of course, the roll of the die!

Credits:
Sanio - prompt system code
Mr. SeemsGood - enemies and boss code
AnglerFishart - sprites and art
